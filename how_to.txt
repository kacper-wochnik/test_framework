...how to...

1. Please download uploaded test_framework.zip file
2. Unpack it and import as existing maven project (I would recommmend latest mvn & JDK)
3. To run single test using command line, when in project location use: mvn -Dtest=First_test test

In terms of any issues please see attached recording
